Valid Bracket Sequence STRICT
~~~
Given a string representing a bracket sequence with open and closed parentheses, return whether or not the bracket sequence is valid.
A bracket sequence is valid if it is balanced (i.e. the number of closed parentheses and open parentheses is equal), and there is never a point in the sequence where there are more closed parentheses before it than open parentheses.
